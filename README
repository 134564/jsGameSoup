jsGameSoup
----------

jsGameSoup is a Free Software framework for making games for the web using only Javascript and the canvas tag. It currently runs under new versions of Firefox, Safari, IE 6.0, and IE 7.0. It doesn't depend on any proprietary technologies like Flash or Silverlight.

jsGameSoup is copyright Chris McCormick, 2009, and is licensed to you under the terms of the LGPL. Please see the file COPYING for details.

jsGameSoup is pretty beta, but you can already make games with it.

Download
--------

You can download a [zipfile of the latest version of the sourcecode](jsGameSoup.zip) which includes the important bit [jsgamesoup.js](js/jsgamesoup.js).

If you use [bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) you can bzr checkout or bzr branch from the following repository:

Documentation
-------------

Probably the most important bit of documentation is [jsGameSoup's API](jsdocs).

Because jsGameSoup graphics are rendered using the canvas tag, the [canvas documentation](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#the-canvas-element) is also useful, as well as [Mozilla's canvas demos page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/drawing_graphics_with_canvas). Finally, the [canvas cheatsheet](http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/canvas_sheet/HTML5_Canvas_Cheat_Sheet.png) by Jacob Seidelin is very useful too. Be aware that jsGameSoup uses the iecanvas.js library for Internet Explorer compatability and so not everything works 100%, although most of the important bits do.

Quick Start
-----------

The main component of the framework is the JSGameSoup() object, which is the engine of the system. When the jsgamesoup.js script is loaded, it will attach a new JSGameSoup() engine to every canvas which has an attribute 'jsgs'. The attribute 'jsgs' specifies the name of the function which should be called to launch the game script associated with that canvas. The 'fps' attribute specifies the desired frames rate of the game engine for that canvas.

Once the jsGameSoup engine has been attached to the canvas it starts running immediately. The jsGameSoup engine keeps a list of objects to update and draw every frame. In order to make things happen in your game, you should create objects and add them to the engine with the addEntity() method.

Here is some example code to get you going. You should be able to paste this into an HTML document with jsgamesoup.js and excanvas.js installed in the correct subdirectories.

	<!--[if IE]><script src="js/explorercanvas/excanvas.js"></script><![endif]-->
	<script src='js/jsgamesoup.js'></script>
	<script>
	function startGame(gs) {
		// our demo game entity
		function Thingy() {
			this.draw = function(c, gs) {
				c.moveTo(10, 10);
				c.lineTo(10 + 10 * Math.sin(), 10 + 10 * Math.cos());
			}
		}
		gs.addEntity(new Thingy());
	}
	</script>
	<canvas id='mygame' jsgs='startGame' fps="25"></canvas>
